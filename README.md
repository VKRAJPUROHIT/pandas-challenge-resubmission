PyCitySchools Homework resubmission 

This pandas script in Jupyter Notebook tries to analyze the disctrict wide school standardized test results. 

I have aggregated the school data I obtained and analyzed the following trends:

High level district wise snapshot of the school metrics

Summary of metrics for each school

Top perfoming schools by % overall passing

Bottom performing schools by % overall passing

Scores by school spending

Scores by school size

Scores by school type

Thank you
